\section{Introduction}
In this project, we implemented a simple file transfer system using TCP sockets in C. The system consists of a server that receives a file from a client. The file is transferred over TCP in chunks.

\section{Protocol Design}
The protocol between the client and the server is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The client connects to the server and sends the file in chunks.
    \item The server receives the file, writes it to disk, and sends an acknowledgment message once the transfer is complete.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Organization}
The system consists of a client and a server that communicate using TCP sockets. The client sends the file, and the server listens for incoming connections and saves the file.

    \draw[->] (0.8, 0) -- (3.2, 0) node[midway, above] {File Transfer};
\end{tikzpicture}

\section{Implementation}
The client and server are implemented in C using the socket library. Below is a snippet of the server code that receives the file:

\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#define PORT 12345
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
void receive_file(int client_socket) {
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    FILE *fp = fopen("received_file.txt", "wb");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return;
    }
    int bytes_received;
    while ((bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0)) > 0) {
        fwrite(buffer, sizeof(char), bytes_received, fp);
    }
    printf("File received successfully.\n");
    fclose(fp);
    send(client_socket, "TRANSFER_COMPLETE", 17, 0);
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}
This project successfully demonstrates the use of TCP sockets to transfer files between a client and a server. The system is capable of transferring files in chunks and confirming the transfer once completed.
